// Room adjacencies follow a one-way definition rule:
// Each connection between rooms is only defined once, where the room with the lower ID
// lists its connection to the room with the higher ID. For example, if room 2 is connected
// to room 5, this connection will only appear in room 2's adjacentRooms list, not in room 5's.
// The GameBoard component checks both directions when determining if rooms are adjacent.
