==============================================
overall plot

* orca is new firefighter
* no time to get trained -- there's a fire now!
   * teamwork is bad, lots of passing the buck, "only the giraffe knows how to do that"
   * lion is good coach, but working with a skeleton crew
   * orca has no clear skills. Isn't sure he belongs.
      * lots of hazing and razzing orca -- you mean you sleep in the water???
      * heat is tough on his skin -- he's dry, can't wait to get home to the bay.
   * rhino is especially excluding of orca
* political problems
   * station is understaffed because neighborhood population is declining; city strapped for money
   * kids in neighborhood don't have a place to play -- last playground was closed
   * kids are always climbing on firetrucks -- that's not a jungle gym!
   * can't you growl at the mayor? no, growling only works for right now.
* orca goes to lioness chief to quit
   * lioness asks orca: who do you care most about making proud? my mom. What would she say? don't look down at your feet -- look up at the horizon
* training
   * orca asks others for training; specialists orient orca (and the reader)
   * they train in clock tower, because old and unused. foreshadows its sensitivity to fire
      * clock tower has debris inside -- old picture frames, etc.
   * they practice running with neighborhood kids (fun and games)
   * orca asks OTHERS to train the same things over again... THEY learn by teaching
   * rhino refuses to teach something that isn't her specialty: hose precision
   * another animal shows orca around firehouse some more
      * old photos of someone who looks like rhino -- it's rhino's dad and grandpa!
* climactic fire
   * orca sees fire on horizon -- it's the clock tower!
   * orca's ideas and collaboration save the day: everyone is able to do what normally is someone else's job
   * orca has crab clamp on to hose, forms a lasso, is ready to throw it; but there's a burst of flame on the roof
   * suddenly, water sprays exactly on the right spot -- it's rhino! rhino went and learned outside her specialty, after all.
   * they save the clock tower.
   * orca is credited with being right. We owe you one! Well, there is something you can do...
* team meeting
   * orca has asked for a team meeting, and says he wanted to quit.
   * says, I need the way we treat each other to change.
   * rhino at first says this is how it has always been done, is resistant.
   * at orca's insistence (and lion's support), rhino closes her eyes, thinks about father and grandfather, and realizes they would be proud of her.
   * and what would rhino say to them? That things can't stand still, we have to learn. Orca showed me that.
   * oh, there's one more thing that orca wants to ask for...
   * but oh no, wrecking ball is going to clock tower site!
* happy end
   * clock tower site is saved -- ff's will use their structural integrity knowledge to shore it up, and make it safe to play on. It's a new playground.
   * Orca has a present for the fire house -- he's framed the photos of rhino's dad and grandpa!
   * Orca slips off to take a dip in the bathtub, feeling at ease.
